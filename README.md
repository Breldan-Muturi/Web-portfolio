## The online portfolio is basically a web page designed using html and css. It's been designed for potential employers who would like to know more about my background information and also inspect projects I've worked on. I've included my photo from 2018 so that in case I have to attend an interview the other party know what I look like. For the various projects listed, the links are to the various GitHub repositories in which they're stored just so anyone interested in seeing my work can clone it and inspect the code from any place in the world. The project is part of an independent project I'm working on at Moringa School where I get to sharpen my skills and this provides an avenue where my technical mentors can assess how far I've come in terms of my skills in writing good code. The online portfolio can also be used by anybody looking for a starting point to build their own web portfolio in which case they can follow the set up instructions here below and then continue to build up from my work.
##  To install the project it is necessary to follow these steps:
* Open https://github.com/Turi-byte/Web-portfolio. On the top right corner of your screen, you should see a button with the text 'Fork'. 
* Clicking on this button should start the process of copying the project/repository to your own account.Click on that button which should result in a modal prompting you to choose the account to which you want to fork.
* Select your account name which should take you to the repo you forked in your account. For example, if your GitHub username is 'Turi-byte', you should select it and not anything else that appears in the modal. This may take a couple of seconds so be patient as the process takes place.
* To know that the forking process is complete, check the top left corner of your repo. You should be in your account in a repo with the same name as the original repository (your_username/Web-portfolio). This shows that the forking process is complete.
* Having copied the repo to your own account, you can then proceed to clone it.Run the git clone command to clone the repo to your preferred location.
* Navigate to inside the cloned repository by using the change directory (cd) command.
* Open your editor by using the command atom . for Atom users or code . for Visual Studio Code users.
* You are now ready to inspect and make modifications to the project.
