        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Breldan Muturi</strong>,a software developer in training at Moringa School.I am also studying electrical engineering at the university of Nairobi and will be graduating in 2021.I took the programming class at moringa because I feel coding should be a staple for any worthwhile engineer; after all, we design the hardware so it follows <em>we should also write what software it runs on!</em></p>
        <p>As for my interests and hobbies, here's some of them:(<em>hopefully you'll find something you can relate with</em>)</p>
